# Descripition 

This Connect 4 is a two-player game which has a GUI. It is a two-player game that prompts the user to play the classic game Connect 4 by selecting the column on which they want to place the pieces. On the board, either side can win by connecting its four pieces in a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each player will switch turns after dropping a chip and this will continue until someone gets four in a row or there is no more place to place chips.And the UI will provide feedback to the user on whose turn it is and who will win.

On the main menu,select the mode(one player or multi player)in which you want to play.Both modes need to set your name and then choose the color for chips you want before the game starts.When either player wins, the game screen is displayed and the player can choose whether to continue the game or exit or return to the main screen to play another mode.




# üíª How to run


‚Ä¢	Download the Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/) or download PyCharm (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/#section=mac)

#There is a little a bit different install packages between Python IDE and Pycham:

Using python IDE:

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ Install the  necessary Libraries (NumPy Library, Pygame module,etc):https://www.askpython.com/python/examples/connect-four-game
  
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
   ``` 
   pip install PyGame
   ```
   ```
   pip install Button
   ```
   ```
   pip install constants
   ```

  (If pip doesn't work, pip3 might work instead. Another way to install numpy and Pygame is to use PyCharm as your IDE and download the extensions through there. You're allowed to download these extensions when hovering over the numpy import statement in connect4.py and the Pygame statement in Button.py.)
  
  Using Pycharm:
  
  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ go to File ‚Üí settings ‚Üí project ‚Üí python interpreter and add install the package you want(ed:pygame,numpy)
  (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/managing-packages-in-pycharm/)

  
  
 ‚Ä¢ 	Clone the repository(https://github.com/cis3296f22/01-connect4group1.git) to your Python IDE or PyCharm and then click ‚Äúrun‚Äù to run  your python file 
  
 ‚Ä¢ You will see the output on your Python IDE
